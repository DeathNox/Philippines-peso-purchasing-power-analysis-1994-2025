# Philippines Peso Purchasing Power Analysis (1984–2025)

This project analyzes the purchasing power of the Philippine Peso from 1984 to 2025, using 2018 as the base year. Data was cleaned and processed using Python, and interactive visualizations were created with Plotly. Visual elements and infographics were designed in Figma. The repository contains Python scripts for data processing, Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, and CSV files with historical economic data. Results help illustrate how inflation and economic factors have affected the real value of the peso across decades.
